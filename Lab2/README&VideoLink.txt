INFO regarding the running of Lab2 Labview panel

We used a slider to control/turn on and off the Lowpass filter.
When the slider is at 0, the lowpass is off and normal values are read directly from the accelerometer.
You need to let go off of the slider in order for the lowpass filter to take effect as continously changing the cutoff frequency will lead to irregular values being displayed.
